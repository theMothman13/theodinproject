            <!-- As a reminder, <strong> is used on important text and makes it bold. -->
            <!-- <em> is used to emphasize text, and italicizes it. -->

            <p class="practice" id="p1">There are a few different ways to modify text using base HTML. Things such as strong will make text important and print it in bold like such: <strong>This text is important!</strong></p>
            <p class="practice" id="p2">We can also use em (short for emphasis), to emphasize text and make it italic. For example: this is <em>more</em> important than that.</p>
            <p class="practice" id="p3">To keep track of what your code is doing without displaying it to the user, you'll want to use comments. Comments are created by inserting "<!--your comment goes here-->" into your code. Check the source code for this page for an example.</p>
