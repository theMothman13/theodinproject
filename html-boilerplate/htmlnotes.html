        <h1>HTML Practice</h1>
            <!-- As a reminder, <strong> is used on important text and makes it bold. -->
            <!-- <em> is used to emphasize text, and italicizes it. -->
            <!-- Comments are created using the tags in lines 16, 17, and 18 in this document. -->
            <p>There are a few different ways to modify text using base HTML. Things such as strong will make text important and print it in bold like such: <strong>This text is important!</strong></p>
            <p>We can also use em (short for emphasis), to emphasize text and make it italic. For example: this is <em>more</em> important than that.</p>
            <p>To keep track of what your code is doing without displaying it to the user, you'll want to use comments. Comments are created by inserting "<!--your comment goes here-->" into your code. Check the source code for this page for an example.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
            <!-- Lists are put together using the <ul> (unordered) and <ol> (ordered) tags. -->
            <!-- List items are then defined in with nested <li> tags. -->

        <h2>Links and Images</h2>
            <!-- Links are created using the <a> (anchor) tag. -->
            <!-- To create a proper link, the opening anchor tag must include an href or hyprlink reference. -->
            <!-- Links and images can be relative, or absolute. Line 42 is an absolute link. Line 43 is relative. Line 44 is a relative path for an image. -->

            <!-- .gif image formats are the go-to option for simple animations, but are limited in color -->
            <!-- .png image formats are the option for non-photo, non-animated images -->
            <!-- .svg image formats are designed for responsive environments with their vector-based graphics -->
