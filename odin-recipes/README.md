|Odin Recipes Assignment|
-------------------------

A simple recipe blog containing a few of my favorite homemade dishes.
It showcases relative links to other files (recipes) from the home
page, as well as basic HTML document structure.

Truthfully, I was quite excited and didn't perform any commits until
I nearly finished the project, allowing me to learn about git clean
so I could start again and properly document the process and versions.
