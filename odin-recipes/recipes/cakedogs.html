<h3>Dish Description</h3>
    <p>I learned this recipe from the wonderful people of a Marshallese ward in Arkansas that I spent part of a 2-year LDS mission on. It was a wonderful treat after being out all day, consisting of a delightfully simple recipe. It's basically just a sweet, crepe-wrapped hotdog.</p>

    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Prepare your hot dogs, either microwaved or boiled for the best flavor.</li>
        <li>As you finish each 'cake,' wrap a hot dog in it from one end to the other. CAUTION: The cakes retain their oil, so they will remain HOT.</li>
