<h3>Dish Description</h3>
    <p>This version of Shepherd's Pie has been passed down from my mom to me, her mom to her, and so on, but it's one of those generic family recipes if you know what I mean.</p>
    <p>Where my wife and I differ from my mother is in our spices and seasoning. My wife and I are kitchen witches, and so like to use 'utilitarian' spices, purposeful in their use to help your body into a healthy state. Instead of taco seasonings, we use a mix of earthy herbs that regulate your heart, reduce acid levels, promote energy levels, and taste pretty good.</p>
